# NEXT — Single Focus

Phase 3.1 — Frontend UX polish (Tickets): COMPLETED

Status: Documentation alignment is the final closeout step; no new features should be added until Phase 3.1 docs are finalized.

Next allowed development phase: Phase 3.3 — Admin UX redesign (editor improvements).

Note: Phase 3.2 (Time-based pricing / Early Bird) is COMPLETED and LOCKED. Phase 3.3 is UI-only and requires explicit instructions before work begins.
